# HTML-Client

Web-based client for Cardshifter game. To play the game, or for more information about the Cardshifter project, see:

- [Primary repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Cardshifter/Cardshifter)

### Development
Ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then execute the following instructions using Windows, OS X  or Linux terminal:

```bash
# browse to a directory on your local machine to clone the repository to
cd C:\path\to\my\projects
# copy this repository
git clone https://www.github.com/cardshifter/html-client
# point your console to that directory
cd HTML-Client
# install dependencies - be patient, this takes a while
npm i
# build the project - takes about 2 minutes
npm run build
# run the client
npm run dev
```

This will host the HTML client at `http://localhost:42637` which you can then access with any web browser.
